First off, make sure the Debian server is setup with SSH, and that you can connect with ssh, and have sudo access.
If you set a Root password on the server, you would need to install sudo.
    [[ su ]]
    [[ apt-get install sudo ]]
    [[ usermod -aG sudo <username> ]]
Next, make sure python is installed
    [[ sudo apt-get install python-pip ]]
Also, have the sudoer be password-less
    "%sudo   ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL"
Then, make sure the hosts file for the playbook has the username & password for the target server.
