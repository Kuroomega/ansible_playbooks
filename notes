First off, make sure the Debian server is setup with SSH, and that you can connect with ssh, and have sudo access.
If you set a Root password on the server, you would need to install sudo.
    [[ su ]]
    [[ apt-get install sudo ]]
If you want the user to be able to use Webmin, add them to the sudoer group
    [[ usermod -aG sudo <username> ]]
Next, make sure python is installed
    [[ sudo apt-get install python-pip ]]
Also, have the sudoer be password-less
    "[username]   ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL"
Then, set the hosts file for the playbook to have the username & password for the target server.
You should then be able to run the playbook.
    [[ ansible-playbook main.yml -i ./hosts ]]
